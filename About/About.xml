	<description>Version 2.2.4.0
    This mod adds magic and class development to RimWorld.
	
A RimWorld of Magic adds 17 classes, each with unique abilities and play styles.
Classes are broken down into two arch-types - the fighter and the mage - each represented with common fantasy roles like priests and necromancers.

This mod also adds a robust set of supporting features such as enchantments, class armor and weapons, class agnostic spells, research trees, crafting tables, mythical creatures, portals, and more!
