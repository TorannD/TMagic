<TM_PsionicAugmentation_eff_desc>By injecting psionic power into their legs and core, a psionic is able to rapidly accelerate their movement for a short time.

This attack occurs only if the psionic is drafted and unnarmed.
Training in this skill improves the leap distance and impact force.

Out of combat, the psionic will infuse their stride with mental energy, drastically increasing movement speed for a short time. This ability only occurs when the psionic is near maximum psionic energy and has a work target at a sufficient distance. This will not interrupt ongoing tasks.
