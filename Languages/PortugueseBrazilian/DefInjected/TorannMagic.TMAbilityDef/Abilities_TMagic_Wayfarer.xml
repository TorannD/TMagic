	<TM_FieldTraining.description>Wayfarers do not have class specific abilities, instead, they excel at general combat. 

General combat techniques are discarded by most fighters as supplementary skills which require no additional skill training. The wayfarer takes another approach; by investing time and effort into understanding these combat skills, the wayfarer is able to improve almost all general abilities in utility, power, and efficiency.
