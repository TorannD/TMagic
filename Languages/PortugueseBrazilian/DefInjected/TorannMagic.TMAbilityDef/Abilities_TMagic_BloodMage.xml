	<TM_BloodShield.label>Blood Shield</TM_BloodShield.label>

	<TM_BloodShield.description>Surrounds a target in a barrier formed from the blood energy of the caster. The energy from the shield will slowly regenerate the pawn it is protecting. Any damage done to the shield disperses some of this energy but also causes a burst of healing on the protected pawn.
		
A portion of damage absorbed by the shield will be inflicted on the caster due to the blood link - this includes the gradual healing. As long as the blood mage supporting the shield has blood magic power, any returned damage will detract from this blood power, but if the blood mage is out of blood magic power, returned damage will cause physical harm to the blood mage.
		
Blood mages cannot form a blood shield on themselves.</TM_BloodShield.description>

	<TM_BloodGift.label>Blood Sacrifice</TM_BloodGift.label>

	<TM_BloodGift.description>Combines blood and mana into a hybrid form of power used to perform blood magic. The use of blood sacrifice inflicts several deep cuts to allow ready access to blood and combines it with mana to generate an immediate amount of blood magic power.
	
Blood mages can slowly generate blood magic power from open, bleeding wounds without the use of mana, and can also train to use fresh, exposed blood near them to fuel blood magic.

A blood mage will slowly lose blood magic power when they are no longer bleeding.</TM_BloodGift.description>

	<TM_BloodForBlood.label>Blood For Blood</TM_BloodForBlood.label>

	<TM_BloodForBlood.description>Curses a targets blood to heat and accelerate until it seeps from every pore of its victim. This curse has several affects. 

The blood that's expelled from the target becomes a mist that the caster absorbs as restorative energy and uses it to mend wounds and replenish blood reserves. This ability will slowly heal scars and other permanent injuries of the caster.

The wounds and injuries of a target will also be healed as the blood exits their body. The target loses a portion of their blood each pulse and, like any wound, can result in incapacitation or death if they lose too much blood.

The transfer and healing rate is increased for both caster and victim depending on how much the victim is bleeding. The effects are the same when used on friendly or enemy pawns, but will trigger an outrage if used to down or slay an allied or neutral pawn.</TM_BloodForBlood.description>
