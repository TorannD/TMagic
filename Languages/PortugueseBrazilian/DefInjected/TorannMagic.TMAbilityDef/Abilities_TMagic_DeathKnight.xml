	<TM_Shroud.label>Shroud of Darkness</TM_Shroud.label>

	<TM_Shroud.description>The Shroud of Darkness is a cloak of tangible malice and fear that consumes nearby energy.
	
The Shroud has many different functions and is a crucial component of the death knight's training. Foremost, the cloak provides a defensive bonus against all damage types and slightly increases weapon damage.

It's also able to solidify and retaliate against an attack using spirit damage.

Last, but not least, the Shroud is able to nullify projectiles near the death knight by consuming them in a void.  Projectiles launched from less than 6 cells away will never be nullified.

All of these functions are enhanced as hate levels grow and must have a sufficient level of hate to function at all.</TM_Shroud.description>
