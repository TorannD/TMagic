	<TM_Chi.label>Ch'i</TM_Chi.label>

	<TM_Chi.description>Ch'i, or spirit, is the life force that resides in all living things. Monks cultivate and harness this force to perform their art. Balancing the rhythm and flow of Ch'i takes time and is generally gained through dedicated meditation.</TM_Chi.description>

	<TM_Meditate.label>Meditate</TM_Meditate.label>

	<TM_Meditate.description>Meditation restores the life force of the monk and is a vital component of maintaining a strong level of Ch'i.
	
Any physical or mental ailments must be purged before meditation can generate Ch'i. If the monk is afflicted (wounds, disease, poor mood, drug addictions), meditation will focus Ch'i in an effort to remove the affliction. Afflictions can only be purged while in a meditative state.</TM_Meditate.description>
