	<TM_PsionicStorm.description>The Psionic lets down all mental barriers and unleashes their unrestrained psionic power.

	<TM_PsionicAugmentation.description>Psionic power is a physical manifestation of mental energy in the form of kinetic or potential energy. A Psionic is able to utilize this power most efficiently by directing it throughout their body to reinforce physical action.
	
A well trained psionic is able to achieve incredible physical feats using a blend of psionic and physical strength. Psionic augmentation becomes second nature and occurs naturally both in and out of combat.</TM_PsionicAugmentation.description>
