	<TM_SoulBond.description>Demons, or those possessing the power of a demon, can creates a soul bond (soul contract) with another pawn who will sustain (or host) the bond. The bond provides energy from the soul of the host to the demonkin, in exchange, the emotions of the host are washed away in bliss. The soul bond also creates a link that allows the demonkin to travel to, or summon, the host.
		
The soul bond contract may be canceled at any time by the demonkin by re-using the ability on the current host. Creating a soul bond with another host will cancel any previous contracts. The contract will also end if either party dies or is destroyed. 

Succubi and Warlocks form distinct types of soul bonds - warlocks bonds are mentally reciprocal while a succubus bonds are physical in nature. Demonkin can only sustain a single bond; hosts can only sustain a single bond of each type (mental/physical).</TM_SoulBond.description>
