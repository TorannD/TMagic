	<TM_ArcaneCapacitor.description>The Arcane Capacitor is able to store mana as a form of potential energy that mages can draw upon at a later time. Mages assigned to magic tasks will charge the battery until it reaches its set fill level. A mage will only perform this task if their mana level is above 90% of their maximum.

The arcane capacitor will discharge mana to any undrafted pawn in range if the mana ratio of the capacitor is greater than 250% of the mage. Drafted mages will forcibly draw mana from the capacitor until the capacitor is empty or the mage has 90% or more mana.

Some mana is lost during the discharging process.
Efficiency: 71%</TM_ArcaneCapacitor.description>

	<TM_DimensionalManaPocket.description>The dimensional mana pocket stores a tremendous amount of mana and has a large distribution coverage area but is slower than the arcane capacitor to redistribute mana when it's needed
	
Mages assigned to magic tasks will store mana in the dimensional pocket until it reaches its set fill level. A mage will only perform this task if their mana level is above 90% of their maximum.

The dimensional pocket will discharge mana to any undrafted pawn in range if their mana is below 40% and to any drafted mage with mana lower than 80%.

Some mana is lost during both the charging and discharging process.
