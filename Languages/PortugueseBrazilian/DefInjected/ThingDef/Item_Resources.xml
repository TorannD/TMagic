	<TM_Demonhide.label>demonhide</TM_Demonhide.label>

	<TM_Demonhide.description>The skin of a demon. This material is incredibly tough with a micro-porous material mesh able to rapidly diffuse heat and cushion impact blows better than most non-metals. The blood of a demon is resistant to magic and leather made from the hide of a demon absorbs some of this resistance. Any enchantments carved into demonhide are naturally augmented. There are only two downsides to this material - the first is that it can only be acquired from the carcass of a demon, which makes it both rare and costly; the second is that it makes a terrible insulator.</TM_Demonhide.description>

	<TM_Demonscale.label>demonscale</TM_Demonscale.label>

	<TM_Demonscale.description>Pried from the body of a demon, these scales offer a lightweight and versatile defense against all forms of attack. Demon scale excels as a natural barrier to magic and is an excellent inhibitor to heat and fire; a warrior with enough armor crafted from demon scale may even become immune to all but the most intense fire. Demon scale can be smelted, and weapons forged from this refined metal make excellent bladed weapons. Enchantments etched into demon scale equipment are naturally augmented.</TM_Demonscale.description>

	<TM_Arcalleum.label>arcalleum</TM_Arcalleum.label>

	<TM_Arcalleum.description>A metal alloy consisting of steel, jade, silver and magicyte. Its unique composition gives it mystical properties that increased elasticity and creates reverberations of any magical energy transferred through it. The elasticity of the alloy makes it an excellent choice for blunt protection, but is sub-standard for use in bladed weapons. Arcalleum is difficult to create and requires a forge capable of liquefying and combining all ingredients of the alloy.
	
	While arcalluem is sought after for its enhanced defensive properties, it is also prized by fighters and mages alike for its power to nullify the cooldown of any ability. Each kg of arcalleum worn increases the chance an ability cooldown is nullified after use by 1% (50% max).</TM_Arcalleum.description>

	<TM_Manaweave.label>manaweave</TM_Manaweave.label>

	<TM_Manaweave.description>Manaweave is cloth that has been fused with magicyte and meticulously imbued with arcane symbols. Manaweave inherits many of the physical properties of cloth, but acquires an additional reactive response to physical force. What makes the fabric unique is its ability to act as a conductor of mana that enhances the effects of enchantments and naturally grants protection against light and dark magic. 

Extremely difficult and taxing to create, only a talented and knowledgeable mage can make this material.</TM_Manaweave.description>
