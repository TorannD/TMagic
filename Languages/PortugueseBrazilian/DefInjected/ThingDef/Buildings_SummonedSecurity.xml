	<TM_TechnoTurret_Base_RL.description>The Mark-IV is a deployable turret that provides the firepower of a heavy weapon system. It uses miniaturization to allow the user to easily transport the system when not in use. The key component of the Mark-IV is the matter converter that uses raw energy to repair and resupply the turret when in a miniaturized state, allowing a nominal energy to matter conversion. However, even using plasteel and hyperweave to strengthen the weapon system, the material was simply unable to withstand the pressure placed on it during the conversion process and was high susceptible to breakdown and component failure.
	
Technomancers have since adapted the system and use their control over arcane energy to provide the turret with ammunition while deployed and energy for repairs and the miniaturization process.

Due to its weight, the Mark-IV cannot be moved while deployed.</TM_TechnoTurret_Base_RL.description>

	<TM_60mmMortar_Base.description>60mm Mortar is a personally transportable and deployable indirect fire system. Due to the weight of the system, the shells are typically distributed for transport. The system is intended for indirect fire and only amateurs attempt to use the system for direct lay as it is both inaccurate and exposes the mortar-man. 
	
	The range and firepower of the system are limited compared to stationary systems due the containment capacity of the mortar tube and the blast cartridge.</TM_60mmMortar_Base.description>
